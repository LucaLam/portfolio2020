                <p>After 2+ years of teaching English in Quito, Ecuador, I was on the pursuit for something that offered regular challenges and greater opportunities to learn. That's when I found coding.</p>
                <p>I’ve recently graduated from BrainStation’s 12-week full-time intensive Web Development program and during my time at BrainStation, I have not only learned many programming languages and frameworks, but I’ve also learned to embrace the challenges that development presents.</p>
                <p>I'm hoping to find an opportunity to code meaningful technology with cool people and I hope that technology will better the lives of many.</p>

                <p>When I'm not working or coding, you can find me on a hike and snapping photos, doing brazilian jiu-jitsu, or making a cocktail with Campari.</p>
